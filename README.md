# Introduction 

This project aims to analyse coronavirus impact. Our goal was to find a metric enabling us to measure the confinement degree of a population.

Every 3 minutes, it scans images from webcam in Swedish cities and count people in the streets (using Yolo'darknet CNN). This process enable us to create a database gathering information about confinement in Stockholm and Goteborg.
This dataset is used in further analysis to compare confinement respect with COVID-19 spreading : 
[github repo](https://github.com/MastafaF/corona_confinement_dashboard/edit/master/Readme.md).  
You can visit our [website](https://corona-confinement.herokuapp.com/) with the dashboard using the dataset generated from this repo here. 


Remember: 
### STAY SAFE, STAY HOME!



# TODO:
* Add more positions in Stockholm  
* Think about the metrics to focus on : 
    * Is std relevant enough in the dashboard? 
* Add more tabs if additional source of data for evaluating respect of confinement

Five organizations on Monday released a new open dataset of over 29,000 scientific articles published in journals and on preprint servers, in the hopes of spurring Americaâ€™s artificial intelligence experts to develop new techniques for mining data and text that could help answer some of the most pressing questions about the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes.

The task seems to be questions about the information in the papers
